## Technology

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Vite is a build tool and development server that is designed to be fast and efficient. It uses native ES modules to enable faster development and build times by not bundling the code during development. Instead, Vite leverages the native module system of the browser to serve the code directly to the browser, resulting in faster page loads and faster code updates during development. Vite supports a variety of front-end frameworks and tools and is highly configurable, allowing developers to customize their build process to their specific needs.
- [dat.GUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dat.gui): dat.gui is a lightweight, customizable JavaScript library that allows developers to create graphical user interfaces for their applications. It's often used in creative coding projects and allows for easy manipulation of variables in real-time.
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/): GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is a popular JavaScript animation library that offers a wide range of animation tools for web development. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating complex animations with high performance.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): Three.js is a powerful 3D graphics library for creating web-based 3D animations and games. It provides a simple and intuitive API for rendering 3D objects, animations, and scenes in a web browser, with support for many advanced features such as lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects.
